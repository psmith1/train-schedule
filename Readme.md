This app utilizes Moment.js to retrieve and manipulate information stored in a Google Firebase database. Users can add new trains to the schedule and receive up-to-date information about various trains, including their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

An API Key is included in the code to initialize Firebase.
